# PiSim
## Goal
  The ultimate goal of this is to create a model flight simulator. There will be a physical model, as well as a virtual flight simulator. The physical model will mimic the virtual model as closely as possible. 

## Hardware Materials
  - Raspberry Pi Model 3 B
    - This controls the virtual model using the PyGame module for Python 2.7
  - Raspberry Pi Model 3 B+
    - This controls the physical model using Python 2.7
  - PCA9685 16-Channel PWM Controller
    - This drives all the servos directly from the Raspberry Pi
  - 5V-12A Power Supply Unit
    - Each servo draws 1.2A at max load, so a sufficient power supply is needed
  - Tower MG995 Servos (x7)
    - 180 (deg) servo for controlling the legs and draw bridge for the simulator
  - Arduino ATGMega2560
    - Controls auxillary IO (LEDS, beepers, etc.)
